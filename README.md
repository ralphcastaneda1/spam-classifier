# Spam vs. Ham Email Classifier 

**A Jupyter‐Notebook–driven pipeline to build, validate, and analyze a spam‐email classifier**.

## Introduction

In this project, you will build and improve on the concepts and functions you implemented in Project B1 to create your own classifier to distinguish spam emails from ham (non-spam) emails. We will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and written responses in this notebook.

After this assignment, you should feel comfortable with the following:

- Using `sklearn` libraries to process data and fit classification models.  
- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.  
- Generating and analyzing ROC curves.

### Content Warning

This is a **real-world** dataset—the emails you are trying to classify are actual spam and legitimate emails. As a result, some of the spam emails may be in poor taste or be considered inappropriate. We think the benefit of working with realistic data outweighs these inappropriate emails, but we wanted to warn you at the beginning of the project so that you are made aware.
